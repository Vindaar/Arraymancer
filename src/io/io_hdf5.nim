  ## Exports a tensor to a hdf5 file
  ## To keep this a simple convenience proc, the tensor is stored
  ## in the root group of the hdf5 file under a generic name.
  ## If the `name` argument is given, the tensor is stored under this
  ## name instead. If the `group` argument is given the tensor is
  ## stored in that group instead of the root group.
  ## Note: if no `name` is given, we need to visit the whole file
  ## to check for existing tensors. This will introduce a small
  ## overhead!
  ## TODO: introduce a "num tensors stored" like attribute in the
  ## h5 file, which we write. Instead of visiting the whole file
  ## just access that single attribute.

  ##   - An optional name for a `group` to store the tensor in
